When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the for loop instead of a while loop:

Syntax : for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
           // code block to be executed
         }

Ex : for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
       System.out.println(i);
     }
