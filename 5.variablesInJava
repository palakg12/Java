Variables are containers for storing data values.

In Java, there are different types of variables, for example:

=> String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
=> int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
=> float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
=> char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
=> boolean - stores values with two states: true or false


EX: int myNum = 5;
    float myFloatNum = 5.99f;
    char myLetter = 'D';
    boolean myBool = true;
    String myText = "Hello";


If you dont want to change the value then use final variable.
final int myNum = 15;
myNum = 20;  // will generate an error: cannot assign a value to a final variable
